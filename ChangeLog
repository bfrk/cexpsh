Changes since CEXP-1.4.beta ("Helvetia")

Changes since CEXP-1.3.beta ("good friday")

 2003/7/31:
 - added info about 'xsym' cross tool and updated configure
   magic to do real cross-builds for 'xsyms' (especially if
   using bfd. On a ELF host, it's OK to use a native libelf
   to build 'xsyms' for any ELF(32) target.
 - fixed BFD xsyms '.sym' extension handling.
 - added a architecture check to the BFD loader after getting
   obscure errors when trying to load x86 objects to a PPC
   system :-(
 - hacked libtecla so the 'newline' action passes nonprinting
   characters which ended the line along to the application.
   This can be used to implement 'hotkeys' (as used by the SVGM
   bootloader).
 - simplified HELP macro usage.

 2003/7/1:
 - moved more routines to the public interface:
     cexpModuleName(),
     cexpModuleFindByName(),
     cexpModuleInfo(),
     cexpSymLookup(),
     cexpSymLkAddr(),
 - added routines to access CexpSym internals:
     cexpSymName(),
     cexpSymValue()

 2003/5/20:
 - scanned README for 'who' constructs
 - bfdstuff.c: print more verbose relocation error messages
 - teclastuff.c: bugfix - searching for identifier start character
                          must skip ISIDENTCHAR() a la 'cexp.y'
   this fixes incorrect 'tab completion' when symbol names contain
   digits etc.

 2003/4/25:
 - added a warning (ELF only) when we find a ".fixup", ".got" or ".got2"
   section - they probably compiled a module with -fPIC...

Changes since CEXP-1.2.beta ("valentine")

 2003/4/23:
 - case handling for gcc/libc with __dso_handle and no __cxa_finalize was
   incorrect
 - assert ( ! (presence of __cxa_finalizer without __dso_handle) )
 - reject presence of __dso_handle without __cxa_finalizer with
   a warning
 - mandrake linux 9.1 / gcc-3.2.2 uses __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize
   for C++ static destructors.
   We now support __cxa_atexit / __cxa_finalize :-)

 2003/4/19:
 - implemented cexpResizeTerminal()

 2003/4/18:
 - use $(BISON) and  $(AUTOxxx) variables with obvious defaults
 - fixed solaris /bin/sh incompatibility issue

 2003/4/16:
 - unbundled 'libelf' and provided a BFD based
   version of 'xsyms'.
 - Toplevel 'Makefile' with rules 'prep' and 'xsyms'
   to call autotools, bison etc. and trivial 'xsyms'
   compilation (needs host-installed libelf or libbfd),
   respectively.
 - made spencer_regexp library reentrant
 - use a wrapper to invoke regexp. Could use 'libiberty'
   implementation but it is ~25k bigger and would need
   some wrapping work.
 - catch attempts to use cexpModuleLoad() when built
   with LIBELF.

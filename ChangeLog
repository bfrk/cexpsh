Changes since CEXP-1.2.beta ("valentine")

 2003/4/16:
 - unbundled 'libelf' and provided a BFD based
   version of 'xsyms'.
 - Toplevel 'Makefile' with rules 'prep' and 'xsyms'
   to call autotools, bison etc. and trivial 'xsyms'
   compilation (needs host-installed libelf or libbfd),
   respectively.
 - made spencer_regexp library reentrant
 - use a wrapper to invoke regexp. Could use 'libiberty'
   implementation but it is ~25k bigger and would need
   some wrapping work.
 - catch attempts to use cexpModuleLoad() when built
   with LIBELF.

What is Cexp?
-------------

The Cexp utility gives its user access to all symbols
present in the currently executing program. Its primary
target is RTEMS, an open source RTOS, but Cexp should
compile and run on virtually any platform supported by
the BFD library.

If Cexp is linked to an executable, it is
possible to invoke arbitrary functions and to
read/write variables (and hence virtually any
memory location) by interpreting C-style expressions.

Cexp can access object files using either libelf
or libbfd. The latter is preferred as it is more powerful:
 - not limited to the ELF object format.
 - cexp implements a dynamic/runtime loader using libbfd
 - using BFD / libopcodes, a disassembler comes for free.
However, linking against the BFD library is subject to
the GPL (whereas libelf is under LGPL). See LICENSING
below for more information.

Description
-----------

CEXP is a simple utility featuring
 - symbol table
 - C expression parser/interpreter
 - type "engine"
 - user definable variables
 - recursive invocation / simple scripts
 - dynamic/runtime 'module' loader
 - disassembler

Cexp knows about the basic C types (no aggregates), i.e.

char,   char*
short,  short*
long,   long*
double, double*
long    (*)()
double  (*)()

and interprets C-style expressions, e.g.

	printf("Hello world")

	some_variable = 0xdeadbeef

	some_double_variable = *(double*)&some_variable

Symbol Table
------------
On startup, Cexp reads the symbol table (either from 
the executable itself, or from a stripped down '.sym'
file) and guesses the variable types from their sizes.
(Guess is only supported on ELF targets.)

In some cases, this guess is obviously wrong, but you can 
always cast the symbol to the correct type. Assume
you have a variable 'str' of which you know it's a 
character array. Since it's size (on an ELF target)
exceeds the size of any known variable, cexp will
report 'str' as 'void'. You may simply re-cast the
symbol using the statement

Cexp> char *str

After that, cexp has 'learned' the correct type.

Arrays are normally 'void' like every symbol for whose
type Cexp cannot make a guess.
It is still possible, however, to
use such a symbol, simply by taking its address and
casting to a different pointer type:
    
Cexp> *(((long*)&some_array)+25)

evaluates to the unsigned long array element
some_array[25]. Alternatively, you can redeclare
its type like in the string example above:

Cexp> long *some_array
Cexp> *(some_array + 25)

Cexp provides a series of lookup functions
for symbols. Most noteworthy:

lkup(char *regexp)
lkAddr(unsigned long addr)

These are just normal C functions which can be
invoked by Cexp. Note that lkup() takes a regular
expression argument allowing for powerful searching.

C-Expression Parser / Interpreter
---------------------------------
The C expression parser has some restrictions:
    - no '?' ':' expression
    - no [], '->'
    - no multilevel pointer dereferencing (since e.g. char**
      is not a valid type, Cexp cannot dereference 
      **addr. You must explicitly cast this:

        *(char*)*(long*)some_char_pointer_pointer

      which assumes that sizeof(long) == sizeof(char*)
      for the particular machine.

However, most of the other operators are available, including
the 'comma' operator and the logical '&&' and '||' with the
correct semantics, i.e. conditional evaluation of expression
parts e.g.

      (dd=deviceDetect(_some_device_address)) && driverInit(dd)

will call the driverInit() function only if deviceDetect()
returns a nonzero value.

The '.' operator (structure field access) has a special
meaning to Cexp: symbol "member" (in an OOP sense) access.
Currently, the only member function defined is 'help'. Consult
the 'Help' section about details.

Function calling:
The user is responsible for feeding properly typed arguments;
unused arguments will be filled with integral 0, which on 
most ABIs is safe.
Since the ELF symbol table (Cexp is not using .stab but .symtab)
provides no info about a function's return type, Cexp assumes
all functions to return long. Floating point functions
must be cast appropriately:

    ((double(*)())sqrt)(2.345)

A lot of type casting can be avoided by using user
defined variables, see below.


Type Engine
-----------
Cexp knows about (and only about) the primitive types listed
above.
NOTE: Cexp treats ALL integral types as UNSIGNED although
no 'unsigned' keyword is used or recognized. The main
reason for this is to save typing. Hence
char is in fact unsigned char etc.

An 'int' type is missing (but could easily added) which
means that on some machines (e.g. an alpha) no 32bit
type is currently available...

User Variables
--------------
Cexp supports (fully typed) user variables which are
visible in a global namespace (i.e. visible to other
instances of Cexp). The name of user variables must
not collide with symbols present in the symbol table.

A user variable is created simply by assigning it
a value which also automatically defines its type.

    hallo="hallo"

creates a 'char*' and assigns it the address of a
string constant. The string is stored in 'malloc()ated'
memory and 'lives' forever. Subsequent use of the
same string (strcmp(a,b)==0) results in re-using the
already stored instance of the string.
String constants must not be written-to!

The type of user variables can be modifed, simply
by re-declaring them, in a C-style manner:

    long hallo

results in 'hallo' maintaining its value (the address
of the string constant) but interpreting it as a long.
Hence

    chppt = &hallo

is an 'disguised' char** and

    *(char*)*chppt

resolves to 'h'

User variables can also hold function pointer and hence
be handy abbreviations for long names and casts.
E.g. a convenient variable can be set for 'sqrt()'
(which returns a double value):

    s=((double(*)())sqrt)

It is then possible to automatically get the correct
return type:

    printf("Let's print a double: %g\n",s(44.34))

Help Facility
-------------

The '.' operator (structure field access) has a special
meaning to Cexp: symbol "member" (in an OOP sense) access.
Currently, the only member function defined is 'help'. I.e.
by typing

Cexp>  some_symbol.help()

You get help information about that symbol. If no help
is defined, or if you request 'verbose' help:

Cexp> some_symbol.help(1)

The symbol address, value and type information are printed
(same format as the 'lkup' output).

You can add/modify help information to a symbol (e.g. a user
defined variable) simply by providing a string argument to
the symbol's help member:

Cexp> long myvar
Cexp> myvar.help("I just created a 'long' variable")

Note that help is stored 'per symbol', i.e. when creating
an 'alias' as in the example above:

Cexp> s=(double (*)())sqrt

the help information is not propagated to 's'. If 'sqrt'
had help information, it would need to be copied:

Cexp> s.help(sqrt.help())

How to Start/Invoke Cexp - Simple Scripts
-----------------------------------------
Cexp has two entry points,

    cexp_main(int argc, char **argv)

and

    cexp(char *arg1,...)

i.e. a 'main' style and a 'vararg' style. The
'vararg' version ends up building an argument list
and calling cexp_main(). It is mainly intended
for recursive invoking 'cexp()' e.g. for 
reading a series of lines from a file.
Note that the string argument list submitted to
cexp() must be NULL terminated. When calling
cexp() from cexp() (e.g. to interpret a script),
this is not necessary, however, because any unused
arguments (up to the internal maximum) are filled
with zeroes...

The calling syntax of cexp_main/cexp is as follows:

cexp [-s <symbolfile>] [-h] [-d] [<scriptfile>]

-h and -d have the obvious effect of printing usage
info and enabling debugging information (only available
if compiled with YYDEBUG defined).

Note that the -s option MUST be used the first time
'Cexp' is started and it must be provided with an
appropriate symbol file. This can be the executable
itself of a stripped version (use the 'xsyms' utility)
to reduce memory usage and loading time on RTEMS systems.
A basic check is made to protect against version mismatch
between the symbol file and the executable.

Once Cexp has loaded the system's symbol table, further
instances will simply use the global system table if
the -s argument is missing.

cexp then reads commands from stdin (using the TECLA
library) or alternatively from a script file.

Cexp ignores any characters present on a line
after it reads the comment characters
'#' or '//'.

Example for invoking Cexp from Cexp to evaluate
a script:

    Cexp> cexp("script_file")

Loadable Modules / Runtime Loader
---------------------------------

When built against the BFD library, cexp is capable of
dynamically loading object files into a running program.
Cexp keeps track of module dependencies. Note that this
only covers symbol table dependencies. Cexp rejects
unloading a module 'A' if there is still another module 'B"
 loaded

a another module.

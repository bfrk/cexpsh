BUILDING AND INSTALLATION HINTS FOR CEXP
$Id$

For building Cexp you will need the
following programs and libraries:

Tools:
------
 - usual (cross) compiler toolchain
 - GNU bison (yacc is not enough).

NOTE: bison is only required if you
         change the grammar 'cexp.y'

Libraries:
----------
 - libelf (vers. 0.8.0 distributed with Cexp)
 - Spencer's libregexp (distributed with Cexp)
 - GNU libreadline (strongly recommended)
   which in turn requires
 - libncurses or libtermcap

NOTE: You can avoid readline/ncurses by
setting USE_READLINE in the makefiles
to YES or NO. You will have no line editing
features, however.

RTEMS NOTE:
Vanilla libelf _wont_ work on RTEMS
right now (at least on the TFTP file system),
because it needs a working 'mmap/munmap'
or at least 'lseek' - none of which are implemented
by TFTPfs.
Therefore, simple wrappers were created which
emulate the required calls by slurping the
entire ELF file into memory and 'mmap'ping
it to libelf.
This works fine for libelf-0.8.0 (reading
the entire file to memory is what the library
ends up doing anyway) but may not work with
future implementations as it makes certain
assumptions (which are safe with 0.8.0)
about how lseek/mmap/munmap are used.

Read the comments in the 'wrap.c' file.

Using the wrappers on an RTEMS system
should be handled transparently by the
(modified) 'configure' script but I'm 
far from being an 'autoconf' wizard...
